# LetsBloom_Assignment

The provided Project represents a Node.js application using Express and Mongoose to create a RESTful API for managing a collection of books. It includes functionality to connect to a MongoDB database, import book data, and define API routes for listing, adding, and updating books. The project structure includes a model for the Book schema, routes for handling book-related requests, and a main server file. Dependencies like Express, Mongoose, and others are managed using npm. The application facilitates basic CRUD operations on a book collection, adhering to RESTful principles. Developers can use this as a starting point for building a book management system.
It looks like you've provided the package.json file for a Node.js project named "interview_task" with version 1.0.0. Here's a brief summary of the dependencies listed in the file:

1.body-parser (v1.20.2): Node.js body parsing middleware.
2.config (v3.3.9): Configuration management for Node.js applications.
3.express (v4.18.2): Web application framework for Node.js.
4.mongoose (v8.0.2): MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
5.nodemon (v3.0.2): Utility that monitors for changes and automatically restarts the server.
Additionally, there are several other dependencies required by the mentioned packages. If you have any specific questions or tasks related to this project, feel free to ask!
The provided code sets up a basic Node.js server using Express and MongoDB for a Book management API. It defines routes for retrieving all books, adding/saving a new book, and updating a book by ID. The MongoDB connection is established using Mongoose. To run the server, execute 'npm start.' Ensure MongoDB URI is set correctly. The server runs on port 8082 by default. For testing, use tools like Postman. Refer to the API routes in 'routes/books.js'. Include instructions on installing dependencies and setting up MongoDB credentials in the README.
